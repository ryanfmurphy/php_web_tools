# PHP Web Tools

This project is in Alpha!  Bear with us.  :)

PHP Web Tools gives you a modular, powerful foundation for building a website in PHP.  It is a coalescence of 3 sub-projects:

* PHP ORM/Router
* DB Viewer for viewing SQL tables and relationships
* Dash - automatic form generator / CRUD UI for SQL Schema

## PHP ORM/Router

Lightweight PHP URL Router and ORM Framework

### Getting Started

* Make sure your web server is setup to route all URLs through `/index.php`.
* Fill out a `or_config.php` file based on `or_config_example.php`.
* Define your models in the `models/` folder, based on the examples in `examples/models/`.
* Define your controller in the `controllers/` folder, based on the examples in `examples/contractors/`.
  You can name it whatever you want, the application will automatically find it and include it.
